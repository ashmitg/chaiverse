## Quick Start With Run Pod
### Just watch the following 3 minutes tutorial, our repo is made to run on runpod ðŸš€ðŸš€ 
[![Watch this video](https://imgur.com/mBwiQby.png)](https://vimeo.com/858817518?share=copy)

1. login to your runpod.io account then go to https://www.runpod.io/console/gpu-cloud
2. From "GPU Cloud", select "Community Cloud", and choose the required GPU to deploy the RunPod Pytorch 2.0.1 Template.For Lora and Reward model training, 1 x A40 is enough!

## Model Training
To train a LLaMA7b model and push it to huggingface it's just 5 lines of code ðŸ¥³

```python
import chaiverse as cv

dataset = cv.load_dataset('ChaiML/davinci_150_examples', 'chatml')

model = cv.LLaMA7b()
model.fit(dataset, output_dir='./my_first_llama', num_epochs=1)

model_url = 'ChaiML/llama7b_dummy' # your huggingface URL
model.push_to_hub(model_url, private=True)
```

## Winning Prizes with Chai Guanaco
```sh
chai-guanaco login
```

Now submit the model you have just trained!

```python
import chai_guanaco as chai

model_url = "ChaiML/llama7b_dummy"

generation_params = {
        'temperature': 1.0,
        'repetition_penalty': 1.13,
        'top_p': 0.2,
        "top_k": 40,
        "stopping_words": ['\n'],
        "presence_penalty": 1.5,
        "frequency_penalty": 1.5
        }
submission_parameters = {'model_repo': model_url, 'generation_params': generation_params, 'model_name': 'my-awesome-llama'}

submitter = chai.ModelSubmitter()
submission_id = submitter.submit(submission_parameters)
```
